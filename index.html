  Did you know turtles are dieing at an alarming rate? Mostly from plastic pollution and illegal hunting. Most of the time a turtle would get stuck in a plastic bag or it would eat plastic by accident, matter of fact anything they swallow usually has microplastics in it. People also usually hunt them a lot and they do it illegaly decreasing the population of turtles to almost extinct. Hopefully in the future people that do these things get arrested and we slowly stop using plastic :)
